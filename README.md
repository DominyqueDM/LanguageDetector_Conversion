# LanguageDetector_Conversion
This code runs a simple GUI which was made using TKinter. 
- It also uses langdetect which is a python library used to detect languages.
- It uses googletrans which is anoher free python library which translates any foreign language to english (default)

*Please note: if the googletrans library does not work for you, do pip uninstall googletrans and then pip install googletrans==3.1.0a0

Attached is a preview of what the GUI looks like
